# To do

 - [ ] Choose venue for paper

 - [ ] Improve formalism of algorithm in paper

 - [ ] Provide example implementation (Guile has one but it has other things
       that can be distracting)

 - [ ] Set up example that shows the program in the paper actually does
       optimize as we say it does

 - [ ] Make patch for Guile 3.0.5 that somehow disables this
       optimization, compares 3.0.5 and 3.0.5', mechanistically
   - [ ] compare sizes of .go files in guile
   - [ ] compare bootstrap time
   - [ ] measure space & time as function of program size
   - [ ] compare gabriel sizes
   - [ ] compare gabriel runtimes
   - [ ] synthetic tests (e.g. unicode classifier)

 - [ ] Think about artifact: Guix etc

 - [ ] Convert to latex
